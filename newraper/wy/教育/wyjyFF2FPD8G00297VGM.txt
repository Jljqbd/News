“进退维谷”，意思是无论是进还是退，都是处在困境之中，维相当于“是”，谷比喻“困境”。与“进退两难”同义，可以翻译为“be thrown into a dilemma”。与英文习语“between a rock and a hard place；between the devil and the deep blue sea”意思相近，表示“between two equally difficult or unacceptable choices”。我下不了决心，陷入了进退维谷的境地。I couldn't make up my mind. I was caught between a rock and a hard place.他显然进退维谷。He was clearly between the devil and the deep blue sea.当你不得不在事业和感情之间做出选择时，真的是进退两难。You were really between a rock and a hard place when you had to choose between your career and your relationship.
